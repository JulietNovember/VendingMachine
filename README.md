# VendingMachine
A vending machine that accepts all US coin denominations and outputs a product.

This project accepts all US coin denominations, keeps track of them and displays the total value to the customer via an LCD, and dispences a product via a numpad
and subtracts the correct amount. 

This project uses infrared sensors to detect the width of quarters, nickles, dimes, and pennies with accuracy and total them. The most difficult part of this 
project was getting the sensors to read the coins quick enough to see the difference between a moving dime and penny.
